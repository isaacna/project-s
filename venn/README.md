# venn
Overview
Venn is an Android application that allows people who share interests or hobbies to find and connect with each other.  Use is simple: just make an account, choose whichever communities interest you, and start swiping through people who are members of these communities.  Each community asks members basic questions about the activity or interest it is associated with, such as amount of weight you can bench press for the weight lifting community.  Additionally, members can create new communities, in case their interests are not represented. 

# Installation
Download and install Android Studio, then clone this repository.  Then install on your android phone by connecting with a USB cord, entering USB debugging mode on your phone, and building the program in Android Studio. Our app has only been tested on APK versions 26 and newer, but should be compatible with older Android systems. 

# Deployment
Deployment of our app would require the development of a backend system.  Our backend was developed using PHP and MySQL and is not included in this repository at the moment.
